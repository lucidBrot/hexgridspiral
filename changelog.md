# Changelog
Best-Effort (Means: worst-effort, actually).

## v0.2.1
* Replace relative links to images with absolute urls, so they should now render in crates.io and docs.rs.

## v0.2.0
* `RingCornerIndex::all_from()`  now takes ownership of its argument. This is more flexible because the caller can choose whether they want to clone or not.
